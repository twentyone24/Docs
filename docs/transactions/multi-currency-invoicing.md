## Creating a Multi Currency Invoice

To enable a multi currency invoice you need to do two things:

1. Create a Customer entry with a [different currency](../../transactions/multi-currency-invoicing/#customer-and-company-currency) from the company currency.
2. Select the Customer when creating a new invoice.

This will display the [exchange rate](../../transactions/multi-currency-invoicing/#exchange-rate) widget.
