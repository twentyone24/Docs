# Journal Entries

Journal Entries are transactional entries used to record transactions that don’t strictly identify as a Sale or Purchase. Such as the transfer of funds from a Bank Account to a Cash Account.

## Creating Journal Entries

To create a Journal Entry first navigate to the Journal Entry page

`Common > Journal Entry`

Then click on the blue `+` button to open a new Journal Entry form.

After clicking Submit, Frappe Books will the make ledger entries and update the account balances.

You can check the entries by clicking Ledger Entries under the `...` menu.

## Examples

These are two examples of how you can make direct Journal Entries to account for transactions that are different from Sales or Purchases.

### Recording Expenses

When you have expenses that you pay at the time of purchase, you can record an Expense directly using Journal Entry.

To do so add two rows to a new Journal Entry form, one for Debit and one for Credit.

Let’s say you incur an expense of ₹5,000 for traveling to a client site, and you paid it directly from your Bank Account, then you must add the following rows:

| Account         | Debit  | Credit |
| --------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Bank Account    |        | ₹5,000 |
| Travel Expenses | ₹5,000 |        |

### Recording Prepayments

When a customer pays for a product or service that you haven’t delivered yet, it cannot be booked as Income yet. This is a Liability for your business to fulfill later.

To make an entry that reflects this, add two rows to a new Journal Entry form.

1. One which Debits the amount into the Bank Account because you have received the payment.
2. Another which Credits the amount into a Liability account you may create known as Prepayments.

| Account      | Debit  | Credit |
| ------------ | ------ | ------ |
| Bank Account | ₹5,000 |        |
| Prepayment   |        | ₹5,000 |
